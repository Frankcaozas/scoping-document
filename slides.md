this project focuses on a provider of rail transit maintenance equipment, The company produces 38 kinds of large-scale rail transit operation and maintenance vehicles, each model involves more than 10,000 structural parts, and the materials, priorities, processes and other requirements of different parts are different. In the long-term implementation process of manual production scheduling in its structural branch plant, problems such as low efficiency and poor accuracy are gradually exposed

- üìù **importance of efficient scheduling** 
  - reduce production times, 
  - minimize costs, 
  - increase overall factory efficiency
  
- **Limitation of current solutions** 
  - traditional heuristic algorithms alostuggle to handle complex multi-objective optimization
  - only partly optimal solutions can be found in some situation

# Aim

<h5>Design a scheduling algorithm and build up its mathematic model to efficiently solve large scale parallel machine scheduling problems.
To tackle the challenges of large-scale parallel machine scheduling, particularly in high-end equipment manufacturing industries, this project proposes the design of an scheduling algorithm. The mathematical model underpinning this algorithm is aimed at optimizing several critical aspects of production processes: priority handling, material type management, and the processing numbers of parts. The objective is to minimize the total completion time of scheduled jobs while optimizing the allocation and utilization of resources.
</h5>

# Assuptions made
- Homogeneous parallel machine problem
- Single Operation Per Machine
- Consistent Machine Operation
- Negligible Transport Time
- Exclusion of Assembly Time

# Mathmatic model
### Stage 2 model: 3 objectives
1. Minimize the number of material changes during the processing of parts.
2. Prioritize the processing of parts with a higher priority
3. Prioritize the processing of parts with higher priority within the same project

#### Implementation of optimization algorithm
Code of simulate annealing with chaotic operator

```py 
def simulated_annealing(initial_temp, cooling_rate, max_iterations):
    current_solution = np.random.randint(0, num_machines, size=num_tasks)
    current_cmax, _ = calculate_cmax_and_schedule(current_solution)
    best_solution = current_solution.copy()
    best_cmax = current_cmax
    chaotic_var = np.random.rand()
    for i in range(max_iterations):
        temp = initial_temp * (cooling_rate ** i)
        chaotic_var = logistic_map(chaotic_var)
        new_solution = generate_new_solution(current_solution, chaotic_var)
        new_cmax, _ = calculate_cmax_and_schedule(new_solution)
        energy_diff = new_cmax - current_cmax
        if energy_diff < 0 or np.exp(-energy_diff / temp) > np.random.rand():
            current_solution = new_solution.copy()
            current_cmax = new_cmax

            if new_cmax < best_cmax:
                best_solution = new_solution.copy()
                best_cmax = new_cmax
    best_cmax, best_schedule = calculate_cmax_and_schedule(best_solution)
    return best_solution, best_cmax, best_schedule
